    <h1>Welcome to my virtual resume</h1>
    <p> My name is Andres Siman. 
        I am currently transitioning careers from customer service to the tech field. I recently became employed at Luzco Technologies, as a Schedule Specialist I. My job will require me to learn about construction, and the schedules of building power lines.
        <br>
        I am also very excited at this moment because Unit 2 of LaunchCode just started and we are now learning how to write HTML and CSS. 
        <br>
        I am ultimately seeking a career in tech that allows me to work remotely. 
        <br>
        I am passionate about computers, I have enjoyed learning many problem solving skills to make sure my programs and OS's run well. I can work with Linux, Mac and Windows.
